      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 29, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. No Money Down to Start</h2>
      <p>
        We do not require payment to reserve your move. You’ll receive a flat-rate quote after your MoveSafe Call. Once you accept the quote, you’ll be asked to submit your deposit to begin coordination.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Deposit & Supply Fee</h2>
      <p>
        After accepting your quote, a deposit will be due to cover coordination and shipment of protective materials (TV boxes, mattress covers, etc.). This amount is typically 20–30% of the flat-rate total and is required to move forward.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Refund Conditions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you cancel <strong>within 24 hours</strong> of paying your deposit and supplies have not shipped, you may be eligible for a full refund.</li>
        <li>If supplies have already shipped, your refund will be reduced to account for shipping and restocking fees.</li>
        <li>If you cancel <strong>within 5 days of your move</strong>, your deposit may be non-refundable due to crew reservation and route planning costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
      <p>
        To request a refund, email <strong>support@trustmovingco.com</strong> with your move details and reason for cancellation. Refunds are evaluated case by case.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Final Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Final payment is due in full <strong>at least 5 days prior to your move date</strong> unless otherwise agreed. Missed or delayed payments may result in cancellation of services.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>
        MovingCo reserves the right to update this Refund Policy at any time. The latest version will always be available on our website.
